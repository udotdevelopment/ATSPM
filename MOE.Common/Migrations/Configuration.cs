Over 125 various enumerations are currently in use.  Then, using an FTP connection from a remote server to the traffic signal controller, packets of the hi resolution data logger enumerations (with its 1/10th second resolution time-stamp) are retrieved and stored on a web server at the UDOT Traffic Operations Center about every 10 to 15 minutes (unless the �upload current data� checkbox is enabled, where an FTP connection will be immediately made and the data will be displayed in real-time).

One of the recommendations from the QIT was to �implement real-time monitoring of system health and quality of operations�.

We are simply able to do more with less and to manage traffic more effectively 24/7.

                  Body = @"There are many uses and benefits of the various metrics.  Some of the key uses are:<br/><br/><u>Purdue Coordination Diagrams (PCD�s)</u> � Used to visualize the temporal relationship between the coordinated phase indications and vehicle arrivals on a cycle-by-cycle basis.  The PCD�s show the progression quality along the corridor and answer questions, such as �What percent of vehicles are arriving during the green?� or �What is the platoon ratio during various coordination patterns?� The PCD�s are instrumental in optimizing offsets, identifying oversaturated or under saturated splits for the coordinated phases, the effects of early return of green and coordinated phase actuations, impacts of queuing, adjacent signal synchronization, etc.<br/> <br/>In reading the PCD�s, between the green and yellow lines, the phase is green; between the yellow and red lines, the phase is yellow; and underneath the green line, the phase is red.  The long vertical red lines during the late night reportTimespan is showing the main street sitting in green as the side streets and left turns are being skipped.  The short vertical red lines show skipping of the side street / left turns or a late start of green for the side street or left turn.  AoG is the percent of vehicles arriving during the green phase.  GT is the percent of green split time for the phase and PR is the Platoon Ratio (Equation 15-4 from the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual).<br/><br/><u>Approach Volumes</u> � Counts the approach vehicle volumes as shown arriving upstream of the intersection about 350 ft � 400 ft.  The detection zones are in advance of the turning lanes, so the approach volumes don�t know if the vehicles are going straight through, turning left or right.  The accuracy of the approach volumes tends to undercount under heavy traffic and under multi-lane facilities.  Approach volumes are used in traffic models, as well as identifying directional splits in traffic. In addition, the metric is also used in evaluating the least disruptive time to allow lanes to be taken for maintenance and construction activities.<br/><br/><u/>Approach Speeds</u> � The speeds are obtained from the Wavetronix radar Advance Smartsensor.  As vehicles cross the 10-foot wide detector in advance of the intersection (350 ft � 400 ft upstream of the stop bar), the speed is captured, recorded, and time-stamped.  In graphing the results, a time filter is used that starts 15 seconds (user defined) after the initial green to the start of the yellow.  The time filter allows for free-flow speed conditions to be displayed that are independent of the traffic signal timings.  The approach speed metric is beneficial in knowing the approach speeds to use for modeling purposes � both for normal time-of-day coordination plans and for adverse weather or special event plans.  They are also beneficial in knowing when speed conditions degrade enough to warrant a change in time-of-day coordination plans to adverse weather or special event plans.  In addition, the speed data is used to set yellow and all-red intervals for signal timing, as well as for various speed studies.<br/><br/><u>Purdue Phase Termination Charts</u> � Shows how each phase terminates when it changes from green to red.  The metric will show if the termination occurred by a gapout, a maxout / forceoff, or skip.  A gapout means that not all of the programmed time was used.  A maxout occurs during fully actuated (free) operations, while forceoff�s occur during coordination.  Both a maxout and forceoff shows that all the programmed time was used. A skip means that the phase was not active and did not turn on.  In addition, the termination can be evaluated by consecutive occurrences in a approach.  For example, you can evaluate if three (range is between 1 and 5) gapouts or skips occurred in a approach.  This feature is helpful in areas where traffic volume fluctuations are high.  Also shown are the pedestrian activations for each phase.  What this metric does not show is the amount of gapout time remaining if a gapout occurred.  The Split Monitor metric is used to answer that question.<br/><br/>This metric is used to identify movements where split time may need to be taken from some phases and given to other phases.  Also, this metric is very useful in identifying problems with vehicle and pedestrian detection.  For example, if the phase is showing constant maxouts all night long, it is assumed that there is a detection problem.<br/><br/><u>Split Monitor</u> � This metric shows the amount of split time (green, yellow and all-red) used by the various phases at the intersection.  Greens show gapouts, reds show maxouts, blues show forceoffs and yellows show pedestrian activations.  This metric is useful to know the amount of split time each phase uses.Turning Movement Volume Counts � this metric show the lane-by-lane vehicles per hour (vph) and total volume for each movement.  Three graphs are available for each approach (left, thru, right).  Also shown for each movement are the total volume, peak hour, peak hour factor and lane utilization factor.  The lane-by-lane volume counts are used for traffic models and traffic studies.<br/><br/><u>Approach Delay</u> � This metric shows a simplified approach delay by displaying the time between detector activations during the red phase and when the phase turns green for the coordinated movements.  This metric does not account for start-up delay, deceleration, or queue length that exceeds the detection zone.  This metric is beneficial in evaluating over time the delay per vehicle and delay per hour Values for each coordinated approach.<br/><br/><u>Arrivals on Red</u> � This metric shows the percent of vehicles arriving on red (inverse of % vehicles arriving on green) and the percent red time for each coordination pattern.  The Y axis is graphing the volume (vph) and the secondary Y axis graphs the percent vehicles arriving on red.  This metric is useful in identifying areas where the progression quality is poor.<br/><br/><u>Travel Time</u> � This metric shows the historical INRIX GPS data that UDOT has obtained for corridors statewide.  The data is a month or two old, however, various days and times-of-day can be graphed and compared."

<b>Operating Systems and Software:</b>

The UDOT Signal Performance Metrics system runs on Microsoft Windows Servers.

The web components are hosted by Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS).

The database server is a Microsoft SQL 2008 server.

<b>Storage and Processing:</b>

Detector data uses about 40% of the storage space of the UDOT system, so the number of detectors attached to a controller will have a huge impact on the amount of storage space required.  Detector data is also the most important information we collect.

We estimate that each signal will generate 11.4 MB of data per day.

The amount of processing power required is highly dependant on how many signals are on the system, how many servers will be part of the system, and how many people will be using the system.  It is possible to host all of the system functions on one powerful server, or split them out into multiple, less expensive servers.  If your agency decided to make the performance metrics available to the public, it might be best to have a web server separate from the database server.  Much of the heavy processing for the charts is done by web services, and it is possible to host these services on a dedicated computer.  

While each agency should consult with their IT department for specific guidelines on how to best deliver a secure, stable and responsive solution, we can estimate that most mid-range to high-end servers will be able to handle the task of hosting and creating metrics for most agencies."
