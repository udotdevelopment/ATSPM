ATSPM

Starting in 2002, Purdue University and Indiana DOT developed a partnership to evaluate the effectiveness of various vehicle detection devices. The result was a published standard in 2012 that defined traffic signal controller event codes, several key metrics, and charts that established the fundamental traffic signal performance measures. From this, Utah DOT developed this open source (Apache V. 2.0) software to automatically visualize these metrics and charts to show traffic engineers how their signals are performing in real-time and thus ATSPM was born. Data metrics include vehicle volumes, arrivals on red, pedestrian delay, split failures, and many more. 

It's possible this software can be configured for other agencies to use.
